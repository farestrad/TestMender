Examining test_vulnerabilities.c

FINAL RESULTS:

test_vulnerabilities.c:16:  [5] (buffer) gets:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Use fgets() instead.
test_vulnerabilities.c:24:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
test_vulnerabilities.c:47:  [4] (buffer) scanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function.
test_vulnerabilities.c:53:  [4] (format) printf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
test_vulnerabilities.c:107:  [3] (buffer) getwd:
  This does not protect against buffer overflows by itself, so use with
  caution (CWE-120, CWE-20). Use getcwd instead.
test_vulnerabilities.c:14:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
test_vulnerabilities.c:22:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
test_vulnerabilities.c:23:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
test_vulnerabilities.c:46:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
test_vulnerabilities.c:80:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
test_vulnerabilities.c:101:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
test_vulnerabilities.c:106:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
